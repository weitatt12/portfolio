                <p className="text-center m-5"> After high school, I started Diploma in Tourism and Hospitality at Reliance College. While attending Reliance College, I started orginise some competiton and   activities in Reliance College Club. By time passes, I realise that I am a very curious person where one of my friend show me what he did for the theme in website form. I feel like try enjoyed spending time on the project up (which is my friend shown me in HTML form), until I graduated with my diploma in tourism and hospitality.
                </p>

                <p className="text-center m-5"> I had been worked in Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur as a Service Crew, Eden Tours and Travel as a Sales Assistant. During time that I'm in Eden Tours, I try to explore more about coding (interm of research) and try out something new after I get my work done.  
                </p>

                <p className="text-center m-5"> Besides, I decided to join coding as a new occupation. So I decided to join NEXT academy. To be honest, at the very first time it took me time for me to understand what is going on and etc. But I keep thinking that "why people can make things happened but I can't", even i asked mentors why and their answer is <strong>"Practice Makes Perfect"</strong> this tell me that keep trying although you are down. Someday, you will realise it.    
                </p>

                <p className="text-center m-5"> As a conclusion, sales expert with over 2 years of experience in the tourism & hospitality industry. Currently, a junior software engineer with can-do attitude and a strong desire to learn and expand my skillsets in web development.
