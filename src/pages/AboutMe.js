                    <p className="text-center m-5"> I decide to explore more coding as new occupation. So I decided to join NEXT academy. To be honest, at the very first time it took me time for me to understand what is going on. But I'm thinking that "why people can make things happened but I can't", even i asked mentors why and their answer is <strong>"Practice Makes Perfect"</strong> this tells me that trying although you are down. Someday, you will make it.   </p>
